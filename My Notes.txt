Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Understanding the Data Structure
Before coding, map out what data you need to capture for each expense:

Single Expense Entry:
- Date (when was it spent?)
- Amount (how much?)
- Category (groceries, utilities, rent, etc.)
- Description (optional details - "bought vegetables at local market")
- Payment method (cash, card, UPI, etc.) - optional but useful
Categories to consider:

🏠 Housing (rent, repairs, maintenance)
⚡ Utilities (electricity, water, internet, phone)
🛒 Groceries & Food
🎓 Education (college fees, books, courses)
🏥 Healthcare (medicines, doctor visits)
🚗 Transportation (fuel, auto repairs, public transport)
👕 Clothing & Personal Care
🎉 Entertainment & Leisure
💳 Subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, etc.)
📱 Other/Miscellaneous
